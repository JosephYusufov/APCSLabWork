        Question 1:

        Create individual array fields for each type you want to represent.
        Create another array field to keep track of the type of each element in the list.
        Create a int field to count the number of elements in the list.
        Create methods that fill up the type arrays which do not represent the next element. (Fill these spaces with any values, the program will consider them junk)
        Incriment/decriment the counter after every addition/removal of an element.
